# Top Lane Champion Performance and Meta Analysis in League of Legends

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of top lane champion performance in League of Legends. By evaluating key performance metrics such as win rates, pick rates, and other relevant data, this analysis aims to identify trends within the current meta and provide insights for balancing champions. The analysis draws on data from 100 top-ranked matches using the Riot Games API.

## Objectives
